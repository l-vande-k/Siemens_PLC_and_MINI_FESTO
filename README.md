# Siemens_PLC_and_MINI_FESTO

The system used in this project consists of Mini Festo components including pneumatic actuators, laser photo gate, and a reflection detector. These sensors and actuators were used to move the parts throughout the system and logically control the assembly and rejection of parts. The whole system is controlled by a Siemens 1214 DC/DC/DC CPU which interfaces with a Siemens Simatic HMI Panel.
