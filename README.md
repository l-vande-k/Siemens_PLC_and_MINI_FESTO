# Siemens_PLC_and_MINI_FESTO

The system used in this project consists of a Mini Festo set up which has phonematic actuators, laser photo gate, and a reflection detector to move the parts throughout the system and logically control the assembly and rejection of parts. The whole system is controlled by a Siemens 1214 DC/DC/DC CPU connected to a Siemens Simatic HMI Panel.
